<h1>Logger LabVIEW Library</h1>
<p>August 2019</p>
<p>Thank you for using the Logger LabVIEW library. Logger is a simple logging utility similar to other <a HREF="https://logging.apache.org/">Log4j libraries</a> but for LabVIEW. Levels are provided for different logging statements: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, and FATAL. The higher the level, the more statements that are written to a file. The creation of "rollover" log files is supported along with organizing log files by Year, Month, and Day folder tree. Minimal error handling VIs are provided for logging or masking errors based on severity. The utility is known to work with 32-bit and 64-bit environments as well as Real-Time targets. Writing to a log file is done on a separate thread to maintain determinism on Real-Time targets.</p>
